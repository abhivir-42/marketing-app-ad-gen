[95m## Task:[00m [92mRefine the following ad script by updating ONLY the selected sentences, optimizing for text-to-speech performance.
Original inputs:
  - Key Selling Points: Great features, easy to use, affordable
  - Tone: Professional
  - Ad Length: 30


IMPORTANT: You MUST ONLY modify sentences marked with [[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION]].
DO NOT change ANY part of sentences marked with [[PRESERVE]].
Your task is to apply the improvement instruction ONLY to the selected sentences.
For any sentence not selected (marked with PRESERVE), return it EXACTLY as provided.
The indices that should be modified are: [0, 1]

Current Script (with selection markers): [['[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 0]] Introducing TEST PRODUCT [[END SELECTED]]', '[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 0]] Professional tone [[END SELECTED]]'], ['[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 1]] Great features and easy to use [[END SELECTED]]', '[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 1]] Calm voice [[END SELECTED]]']] Selected Sentences (indices): [0, 1] Improvement Instruction: Make it more exciting
TEXT-TO-SPEECH OPTIMIZATION RULES: When modifying selected sentences, ensure they are optimized for natural-sounding TTS: 1. Use natural pauses: Add commas, periods, and ellipses (...) for realistic breathing pauses 2. Create emphasis: Use strategic CAPITALIZATION of key words (e.g., "This is CRUCIAL") 3. Ensure proper punctuation: All punctuation must be grammatically correct for clear speech 4. Use short sentences: Break down longer sentences into shorter, digestible ones 5. Maintain a conversational tone: Keep language natural and human-like, not robotic 6. Be concise: Don't add unnecessary words, focus on punctuation and formatting
RESPONSE GUIDELINES: 1. ONLY modify the content inside [[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION]] markers 2. Keep ALL [[PRESERVE]] content EXACTLY as provided 3. Return the ENTIRE script, with your modifications only to selected sentences 4. Remove all markers ([[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION]], [[PRESERVE]], etc.) in your final output 5. Ensure all modifications follow the TTS optimization rules above
VALIDATION PROCESS: Your output will be validated by an automated system that will: - Check that ALL preserved lines are 100% identical to the original - Revert any unauthorized changes to non-selected lines - Report validation errors that could affect the quality of your work
EXAMPLES OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
Input Example: ``` [
  ["[[PRESERVE: 0]] Line one of script. [[END PRESERVE]]", "[[PRESERVE: 0]] Speak with enthusiasm. [[END PRESERVE]]"],
  ["[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 1]] Line two needs improvement. [[END SELECTED]]", "[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 1]] Speak calmly. [[END SELECTED]]"],
  ["[[PRESERVE: 2]] Line three is fine. [[END PRESERVE]]", "[[PRESERVE: 2]] Speak with authority. [[END PRESERVE]]"]
] ```
Proper Output: ``` [
  ("Line one of script.", "Speak with enthusiasm."),
  ("Line two has been improved and made more engaging!", "Speak calmly with a hint of excitement."),
  ("Line three is fine.", "Speak with authority.")
] ```
Notice how: - Only index 1 was modified - Indices 0 and 2 remain EXACTLY as they were in the input - All markers were removed in the final output - The output format is a list of tuples with the script line and art direction

[95m## Task:[00m [92mRefine the following ad script by updating ONLY the selected sentences, optimizing for text-to-speech performance.
Original inputs:
  - Key Selling Points: Great features, easy to use, affordable
  - Tone: Professional
  - Ad Length: 30


IMPORTANT: You MUST ONLY modify sentences marked with [[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION]].
DO NOT change ANY part of sentences marked with [[PRESERVE]].
Your task is to apply the improvement instruction ONLY to the selected sentences.
For any sentence not selected (marked with PRESERVE), return it EXACTLY as provided.
The indices that should be modified are: [0, 1]

Current Script (with selection markers): [['[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 0]] Introducing TEST PRODUCT [[END SELECTED]]', '[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 0]] Professional tone [[END SELECTED]]'], ['[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 1]] Great features and easy to use [[END SELECTED]]', '[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 1]] Calm voice [[END SELECTED]]'], ['[[PRESERVE: 2]] Very affordable [[END PRESERVE]]', '[[PRESERVE: 2]] Enthusiastic [[END PRESERVE]]']] Selected Sentences (indices): [0, 1] Improvement Instruction: Make it more exciting
TEXT-TO-SPEECH OPTIMIZATION RULES: When modifying selected sentences, ensure they are optimized for natural-sounding TTS: 1. Use natural pauses: Add commas, periods, and ellipses (...) for realistic breathing pauses 2. Create emphasis: Use strategic CAPITALIZATION of key words (e.g., "This is CRUCIAL") 3. Ensure proper punctuation: All punctuation must be grammatically correct for clear speech 4. Use short sentences: Break down longer sentences into shorter, digestible ones 5. Maintain a conversational tone: Keep language natural and human-like, not robotic 6. Be concise: Don't add unnecessary words, focus on punctuation and formatting
RESPONSE GUIDELINES: 1. ONLY modify the content inside [[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION]] markers 2. Keep ALL [[PRESERVE]] content EXACTLY as provided 3. Return the ENTIRE script, with your modifications only to selected sentences 4. Remove all markers ([[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION]], [[PRESERVE]], etc.) in your final output 5. Ensure all modifications follow the TTS optimization rules above
VALIDATION PROCESS: Your output will be validated by an automated system that will: - Check that ALL preserved lines are 100% identical to the original - Revert any unauthorized changes to non-selected lines - Report validation errors that could affect the quality of your work
EXAMPLES OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
Input Example: ``` [
  ["[[PRESERVE: 0]] Line one of script. [[END PRESERVE]]", "[[PRESERVE: 0]] Speak with enthusiasm. [[END PRESERVE]]"],
  ["[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 1]] Line two needs improvement. [[END SELECTED]]", "[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 1]] Speak calmly. [[END SELECTED]]"],
  ["[[PRESERVE: 2]] Line three is fine. [[END PRESERVE]]", "[[PRESERVE: 2]] Speak with authority. [[END PRESERVE]]"]
] ```
Proper Output: ``` [
  ("Line one of script.", "Speak with enthusiasm."),
  ("Line two has been improved and made more engaging!", "Speak calmly with a hint of excitement."),
  ("Line three is fine.", "Speak with authority.")
