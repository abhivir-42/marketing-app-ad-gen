  description: >
    Refine the following ad script by updating ONLY the selected sentences, optimizing for text-to-speech performance.
    
    Original inputs:
      - Key Selling Points: {key_selling_points}
      - Tone: {tone}
      - Ad Length: {ad_length}
    
    {explicit_instruction}
    
    Current Script (with selection markers): {current_script}
    Selected Sentences (indices): {selected_sentences}
    Improvement Instruction: {improvement_instruction}
    
    TEXT-TO-SPEECH OPTIMIZATION RULES:
    When modifying selected sentences, ensure they are optimized for natural-sounding TTS:
    1. Use natural pauses: Add commas, periods, and ellipses (...) for realistic breathing pauses
    2. Create emphasis: Use strategic CAPITALIZATION of key words (e.g., "This is CRUCIAL")
    3. Ensure proper punctuation: All punctuation must be grammatically correct for clear speech
    4. Use short sentences: Break down longer sentences into shorter, digestible ones
    5. Maintain a conversational tone: Keep language natural and human-like, not robotic
    6. Be concise: Don't add unnecessary words, focus on punctuation and formatting
    
    RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
    1. ONLY modify the content inside [[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION]] markers
    2. Keep ALL [[PRESERVE]] content EXACTLY as provided
    3. Return the ENTIRE script, with your modifications only to selected sentences
    4. Remove all markers ([[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION]], [[PRESERVE]], etc.) in your final output
    5. Ensure all modifications follow the TTS optimization rules above

    VALIDATION PROCESS:
    Your output will be validated by an automated system that will:
    - Check that ALL preserved lines are 100% identical to the original
    - Revert any unauthorized changes to non-selected lines
    - Report validation errors that could affect the quality of your work

    EXAMPLES OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR:

    Input Example:
    ```
    [
      ["[[PRESERVE: 0]] Line one of script. [[END PRESERVE]]", "[[PRESERVE: 0]] Speak with enthusiasm. [[END PRESERVE]]"],
      ["[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 1]] Line two needs improvement. [[END SELECTED]]", "[[SELECTED FOR MODIFICATION: 1]] Speak calmly. [[END SELECTED]]"],
      ["[[PRESERVE: 2]] Line three is fine. [[END PRESERVE]]", "[[PRESERVE: 2]] Speak with authority. [[END PRESERVE]]"]
    ]
    ```
    
    Proper Output:
    ```
    [
      ("Line one of script.", "Speak with enthusiasm."),
      ("Line two has been improved and made more engaging!", "Speak calmly with a hint of excitement."),
      ("Line three is fine.", "Speak with authority.")
    ]
    ```

    Notice how:
    - Only index 1 was modified
    - Indices 0 and 2 remain EXACTLY as they were in the input
    - All markers were removed in the final output
    - The output format is a list of tuples with the script line and art direction
  expected_output: >
    List of tuples formatted as:
    [
      ("Line 1 text", "Voice direction for line 1"),
      ("Line 2 text", "Voice direction for line 2"),
      ...
    ]
