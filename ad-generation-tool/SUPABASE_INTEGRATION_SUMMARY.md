# Supabase Integration Summary

## Problem Solved

The application was previously using browser localStorage for state persistence, which works fine in local development but fails in production environments like Vercel. This is because:

1. localStorage is browser-specific and doesn't persist across different serverless functions
2. localStorage isn't available during server-side rendering
3. localStorage data is lost when users clear their browser cache or use different devices

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a hybrid storage solution that:

1. Uses Supabase as a persistent database in production environments
2. Falls back to localStorage in development for faster iteration
3. Maintains the same API interface so components don't need to know which storage is being used

## Key Components Added

1. **Supabase Client** (`src/services/supabase.ts`)
   - Connects to the Supabase project
   - Manages anonymous session IDs for user identification

2. **Storage Service** (`src/services/storage.ts`)
   - Provides a unified API for storage operations
   - Automatically switches between Supabase and localStorage based on environment
   - Handles all serialization/deserialization of data

3. **Database Schema** (`supabase_table_setup.sql`)
   - Creates a flexible key-value store for all user data
   - Implements proper indexing for performance
   - Sets up row-level security policies

## Files Modified

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added Supabase URL and API key to `.env.local`, `.env.production`, and `vercel.json`

2. **Components**
   - Updated `ScriptGenerationPage.tsx`, `ResultsPage.tsx`, and `Header.tsx` to use the storage service
   - Replaced direct localStorage calls with async storage service methods

## How to Test

1. **Local Development**
   - Run `npm run dev` to test with localStorage fallback
   - Verify that all functionality works as before

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Verify that data persists across page refreshes and browser sessions
   - Test on multiple devices with the same session ID

## Next Steps

1. Execute the SQL in the Supabase dashboard to create the required table
2. Deploy the changes to Vercel
3. Test the application thoroughly in the production environment
